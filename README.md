# Hangman-Game

## Game Rules:
User guesses a letter, letters guessed are displayed, correct letters are inserted into the mystery word, if you guess the mystery word before the max guesses count is reached, you win! Timer then resets and new game is ready to be played.

* When the user wins, a `green winner banner` is displayed at the top that says: **CONGRATULATIONS YOU WON!**

* When the user loses, a `red loser banner` is displayed at the top that says: **OH NO! BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!**
